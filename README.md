# Alternative Fitbit gallery project

## Why?

Fitbit gallery has some flaws.

- You can't save any of watchfaces or apps you like for later use.

- You can't filter out apps or see if they require payments from the list.

This is alternative gallery to fix just that.

## Try it out

## Notes

- You will have to end up in fitbit gallery to install and use the apps (there are buttons when you open the app details to get to fitbit's website).

- None of your information is sent or stored anywhere. Except your browser.
