# Alternative Fitbit gallery project

Note:

Since fitbit implemented "free" app and watchface section in official gallery <https://gallery.fitbit.com/> there's no real use for this project. Personally I used it only for that.

Only useful thing might be "saving" apps for later. For me it's more convenient to save watchfaces in website, rather than creating bookmarks or something like that.

## Why

Fitbit gallery has some flaws.

- You can't save any of watchfaces or apps you like for later use.
- <s>You can't filter out apps or see if they require payments from the list.</s> They did implement this one.

This is alternative gallery to fix just that.

## Try it out

## Notes

- You will have to go to fitbit gallery to install and use the apps (there are buttons when you open the app details to go to fitbit's website).
- None of your information is sent anywhere. Except your browser.

## TODOs

- Save filter state between page reloads.
